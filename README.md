# Student Portal System - C++ File Handling Project

## üìù Description
A console-based student management system developed during my 2nd semester (2022) at University of Central Punjab. This project demonstrates fundamental file handling operations in C++ while adhering to curriculum constraints that prohibited using functions, OOP, or advanced concepts at that stage of learning.
